# Tutorials

> **Note**: This project is a work in progress. The examples and information below will be gradually expanded. New examples and concepts will be added over time to cover more C# topics.

## Description
**Tutorials** is a project designed to provide practical examples and fundamental concepts of C# programming. Aimed at students, this project covers essential aspects of object-oriented programming as well as advanced features of the C# language. The goal is to enable students to learn interactively and progressively by exploring concrete and well-commented examples.

## Objectives
- Introduce the basics of programming in C#.
- Illustrate core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.
- Explain fundamental data structures and algorithms in C#.
- Provide examples of real-world use cases for advanced features like exception handling, LINQ, asynchronous programming, and more.
- Prepare students to apply their knowledge in real projects and review exercises.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into different directories, each containing code examples for specific concepts:

- **01_Basics**: Introduction to C# basics (data types, operators, conditions, loops).
- **02_OOP**: Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).
- **03_DataStructures**: Examples of common data structures (arrays, lists, dictionaries).
- **04_AdvancedFeatures**: Advanced C# features such as LINQ, exception handling, asynchronous methods.
- **05_DesignPatterns**: Examples of design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.).
- **06_PolymorphismExamples**: Specific cases of polymorphism (static, dynamic, interfaces) to illustrate different types of polymorphism.

Each folder contains subfolders or `.cs` files for each example, with explanations in comments to facilitate understanding.

## Included Examples
Hereâ€™s an overview of some of the examples included in the project:

- **Static and Dynamic Polymorphism**: Using method overloading and method overriding.
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data and controlling access through properties and methods.
- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Differences between the two and practical usage in projects.
- **Exception Handling**: Using try-catch-finally blocks and creating custom exceptions.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Introduction to `async` and `await` keywords.
